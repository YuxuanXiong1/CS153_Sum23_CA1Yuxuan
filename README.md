This is the Final Project for COSI 153A: Mobile App Development of Yuxuan Xiong and Zone Zhang.
In this program we designed a todo list app, which the user could enter the things he or she wants to do into the app, and it will be stored within the app through asynchronous storage.
We also added an API of ChatGPT and combined it together with the todo list. You can choose to aski ChatGPT for some suggestions first before adding the things into the list. 
There is also a photo recorder and camera function in the app. They use asynchronous storage to storge pictures within the app. The user could choose to upload images from their phones, or they could also take one through their cameras. After uploading the photos into the app, they could also add descriptions to the photos.
